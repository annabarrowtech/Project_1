# 07 Project 1: Interactive Front-End Application

## User Story
* As a bookreader, I want to search OpenLibrary for the books that they have available. Then, I want to be able to view reviews for the books that fit my search criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria
* #1. When I load the website, a user-friendly responsive layout is presented with a search button.
* #2. When I want to search for a book, I can search for the book by the author name or by book name.
* #3. After I type in my search terms, I can search for the book in Open Library.
* #4. When the search results populate, they populate in a logical manner and the layout remains user-friendly.
* #5. When I click on a search result, I am taken to a review of the book for that search result.
* #6. My search results are locally stored, so I can reference back to them.
* #7. If I don't know what I want to search, I can just look up the New York Times Best Sellers List. 
* #8. If I am interested in a book, I am presented with an option to buy it.
